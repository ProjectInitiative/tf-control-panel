## Purpose

[tf-control-panel][3] was inspired by rodgomesc's
"[avell-unofficial-control-center][4]" repository on GitHub. The goal
was to port the primary functionality of that project to Rust, and make
quality-of-life improvements as wanted and/or requested.

Starting off, we'd like to prioritize the feature of being able to
control the keyboard RGB lighting.

**Other ideas we've discussed:**

  - Improved user customization (e.g., color picker) from hardcoded
    presets
  - Web interface
  - Fan control profiles
  - Internationalization & localization
